# Environment Setup

This document describes how to configure your local development environment for the **MOTO PROTOCOL SPL Token Project**. It includes:

1. Checking and switching Node.js versions
2. Managing PNPM versions
3. Handling build or installation errors
4. Adjusting file structures for TypeScript compilation
5. Example screenshots of each step

> **Note:** These steps are demonstrated on a Windows environment, but the general approach applies to other OS as well.

## 1. Checking Node.js Versions

When working with Metaplex or Umi-based projects, Node.js 16 LTS or 18 LTS is recommended to avoid compatibility issues. Non-LTS or cutting-edge versions (like 22.x) may cause errors with workspaces or build tools.

1. **Check your current Node version and list installed versions:**

```sh
node -v
nvm list
```

Switch to Node 16 or 18 if necessary:

```sh
nvm install 16.20.0
nvm use 16.20.0
# or
nvm install 18.14.0
nvm use 18.14.0
```

Verify your active Node.js version:

```sh
node -v
```

*In this image, you can see the commands node -v and nvm list, showing Node.js versions 18.14.0, 22.13, and 16.20.0.*

## 2. Package Manager Setup

### 2.1 PNPM vs. Node Version
- If you are on Node 16, you often need PNPM 7.x to avoid errors.
- If you are on Node 18, you can generally use the latest PNPM (9.x or above).

Check your PNPM version:
```sh
pnpm -v
```

If PNPM requires Node 18 but you want Node 16 (or vice versa), you might see errors like `ERROR: This version of pnpm requires at least Node.js v18.12`.

```sh
npm uninstall -g pnpm
npm install -g pnpm@7
```

*Demonstrates running pnpm -v, uninstalling, reinstalling PNPM, etc.*

## 3. Handling PNPM Installation Errors

Sometimes installing or upgrading PNPM leads to immediate errors (e.g., "Unsupported URL Type 'workspace:*'").

![PNPM Install Error](../../.github/images/setup/pnpm-install-error.png)
*Here you can see the user running pnpm -v, then npm uninstall -g pnpm, npm install -g pnpm@7, and an error occurs.*

## 4. Attempting a Build (PNPM)

After installing or updating PNPM, you'll typically run:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

![PNPM Build Error](../../.github/images/setup/pnpm-build-error.png)
*Shows a user running pnpm install and pnpm run build with resulting errors.*

## 5. File Structure Setup

When working with TypeScript, you often need a src folder (referenced in tsconfig.json). If your .ts files are in the root folder, you'll see an error about "No inputs were found."

Steps:
1. Create src/
2. Move .ts files into src/
3. Verify or update tsconfig.json to include "src/**/*"

![File Structure Setup](../../.github/images/setup/file-structure-setup.png)
*Demonstrates using mkdir src, move *.ts src/, and ls src.*

## 6. Dist Folder and Build Errors

If you create a dist/ folder and move .js files there manually, TypeScript or PNPM may not know where to place compiled outputs.

![Dist Build Error](../../.github/images/setup/dist-build-error.png)
*Shows the user doing mkdir dist, move *.js dist, and then pnpm run build failing.*

## 7. Final Build Success

Sometimes you'll need to remove or rename a problematic file to fix a TypeScript conflict. After that, re-running pnpm run build might succeed.

![Build Error Resolved](../../.github/images/setup/build-error-resolved.png)
*Shows the user deleting the problematic file and re-running the build successfully.*

## 8. Tips & FAQ

**Q1. "I keep getting TypeScript errors about missing names or top-level await."**  
A1: Ensure your tsconfig.json includes "target": "es2020" or higher (like "esnext") and that your code has import or export statements at the top if using top-level await.

**Q2. "Unsupported URL Type 'workspace:' error."**  
A2: Usually a mismatch in Node.js â†” PNPM versions. Switch to Node 16 or 18 and use a PNPM version that supports it.

**Q3. "Resource in use" error on Windows when deleting a folder.**  
A3: Close all terminals/explorer windows referencing that folder, or open a new admin PowerShell to remove it.

**Q4. "No inputs were found in config file" (TypeScript error).**  
A4: Check your tsconfig.json include paths (e.g., "src/**/*") and ensure your .ts files are inside src/.

## 9. Conclusion

By aligning Node.js (16 or 18) with the correct PNPM version (7.x for Node 16, 9.x for Node 18) and maintaining a consistent file structure for TypeScript, you can avoid most environment setup issues. If errors persist, refer to the screenshots above or the FAQ for common troubleshooting steps.
