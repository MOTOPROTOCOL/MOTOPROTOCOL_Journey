# Basic Examples for MOTO PROTOCOL (for test)

This directory contains basic examples for interacting with MOTO PROTOCOL (MTP) tokens (for test) on the Solana blockchain. These examples are intended to serve as both educational resources and portfolio materials for Developer Relations and Technical Writing roles, developed through extensive debugging documented in `docs/journey/debugging-notes.md`.

## Project Overview

MOTO PROTOCOL is an SPL token project that demonstrates:
- Token creation and minting
- Basic metadata management (with plans for full Metaplex integration) 
- Token transfer processes and balance checking
- Advanced topics such as batch processing

These examples provide real-world applications, including token dashboards, payment systems, and wallet integrations.

## Examples Overview

1. **Token Information (token-info.ts)**  
   **Purpose**: Fetch and display comprehensive on-chain token data including supply and authority information, with metadata support where available.  
   **Key Features**:  
   - Attempts on-chain metadata retrieval with fallback to basic info if unavailable  
   - Formatting of supply and decimals  
   - Authority status verification  
   - Color-coded console output for better readability  
   **Applications**: Token dashboards, supply monitoring, DEX verification tools  

2. **Token Transfer Example (transfer-tokens.ts)**  
   **Purpose**: Demonstrate secure SPL token transfers between wallets with proper validation and error handling.  
   **Key Features**:  
   - Command-line mode for automated execution  
   - Ensures token account existence  
   - Detailed transaction feedback and confirmation  
   **Applications**: Payment systems, token distribution platforms, wallet integrations  

3. **Token Balance Checker (check-balance.ts)**  
   **Purpose**: Query the wallet's token balance with robust error handling.  
   **Key Features**:  
   - Wallet balance checking  
   - Proper handling of token decimals  
   - Comprehensive error messages  
   - Flexibility to work on both Devnet and Mainnet  
   **Applications**: Portfolio tracking, balance monitoring systems, transaction verification  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 16 or 18 LTS recommended  
- **Package Manager**: PNPM or NPM  
- **Solana CLI**: Properly configured (e.g., `solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com`)  
- **Wallet**: A wallet with enough SOL for transaction fees  
- **Metaplex JS SDK**: Cloned repository or installed package  
- **TypeScript**: `ts-node` for running `.ts` files  

### Installation

**Install Dependencies**: Run the following command in your project directory:  
```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata @metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults @metaplex-foundation/umi dotenv chalk
```

**Verify Your Environment**: Check your Node.js version and ensure the Solana CLI is configured correctly:
```bash
node -v
solana config get
```

## Running the Examples

### Token Information
Fetch token information by running:
```bash
ts-node token-info.ts D9FChW1G6LnFBnXfVNphoGqsgDGbCaWDRVvNJyEFsFDM
```

### Token Transfer
Transfer tokens using:
```bash
ts-node transfer-tokens.ts D9FChW1G6LnFBnXfVNphoGqsgDGbCaWDRVvNJyEFsFDM 10 GZeQMMzrZdhg2h4CctUFBDGU2mv1R6uJY1LdAGSvpBHp
```

### Token Balance Checker
Check the wallet balance:
```bash
ts-node check-balance.ts  # Uses wallet from CONFIG.WALLET_FILE
```

## Development Journey

These examples were developed as part of a broader learning journey. Key insights include:

- **Environment Setup Challenges**: Overcoming Solana toolchain configuration issues. (See: docs/journey/environment-setup.md)

- **Debugging Process**: Reduced batch process time from 644s to 25s through detailed troubleshooting of RPC errors, transaction timeouts, and API compatibility issues. (See: docs/journey/debugging-notes.md)

- **DevRel Perspective**: Approaching blockchain development from a user-centric view, emphasizing clear documentation and troubleshooting for the community. (See: docs/journey/lessons-learned.md)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **RPC Connection Errors**:
   If you encounter errors like fetch failed, switch RPC endpoints in your .env file:
   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet
   ```

2. **Insufficient SOL**:
   Get free SOL from https://solfaucet.com for Devnet testing if your wallet balance is low.

3. **Token Account Not Found**:
   The recipient might lack an associated token account; our examples handle this automatically.

4. **Metadata Not Found**:
   Run mint-test-tokens.ts with Metaplex metadata support or use a token with existing metadata.
