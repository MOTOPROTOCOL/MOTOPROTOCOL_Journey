# MOTO PROTOCOL SPL Token Project

## üìå Quick Start
- **Installation requirements:** Node.js, npm, Solana CLI, etc.
- **Basic setup commands:** Environment configuration, token creation, and metadata setup.
- **Quick usage example:** Running basic commands to create and list your SPL token.

## üéØ Features
- SPL Token Creation
- Metadata Management
- DEX Listing
- [Future] Marketing Automation
// ... existing code ...

## üõ† Installation
- **Prerequisites:** Node.js (latest LTS), npm, and Solana CLI.
- **Step-by-step installation:** See [Setup Guide](./docs/setup-guide.md).
## üß™ Test Environment Setup
1. **Create Test Wallet**
   ```bash
   # Create a new test wallet
   solana-keygen new --outfile test-wallet.json

   # Get SOL from Devnet faucet
   solana airdrop 1 $(solana-keygen pubkey test-wallet.json) --url devnet
   ```

2. **Create & Setup Test Tokens**
   ```bash
   # Create and mint new test tokens
   npm run mint:test-tokens
   
   # Save the output addresses:
   # MINT_ADDRESS=<your-token-address>
   # TOKEN_ACCOUNT=<your-token-account>
   ```

3. **Update Token Address**
   - Open these files and update the token address with your MINT_ADDRESS:
     - docs/examples/basic/check-balance.ts
     - docs/examples/basic/token-info.ts
     - docs/examples/basic/transfer-tokens.ts
     - docs/examples/advanced/batch-process.ts

4. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   # Check your token balance
   npm run example:balance
   
   # Should show: Wallet balance: <SOL amount>, MTP: 1000000
   
   # View token information
   npm run example:info
   ```

5. **Run Batch Process**
   ```bash
   # Basic sequential execution
   npm run batch
   ```


## üîß Troubleshooting

- If token balance is 0:
  - Make sure you've updated all files with your MINT_ADDRESS
  - Try minting tokens again: `npm run mint:test-tokens`
- If transfer fails:
  - Check SOL balance for fees
  - Verify token balance is sufficient

### Common Issues

1. **Token Transfer Issues**
   ```bash
   Error: Insufficient balance. You have 0 tokens but tried to send 1.
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Check if your wallet has enough tokens
   - Verify the token address is correct
   - Make sure you're using the right wallet file
   ```bash
   # Verify token balance first
   npm run example:balance
   
   # Then try transfer with correct parameters
   npm run example:transfer -- <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT>
   ```

2. **Script Path Errors**
   ```bash
   Script file not found: <filepath>
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Verify all example scripts are in the correct directory
   - Check file permissions
   - Make sure you're running from project root

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Always use test wallet for development
   - Keep test tokens separate from production
   - Use Devnet for testing

### Best Practices
1. Always check balances before transfers
2. Use `--continue-on-error` flag for batch operations
3. Test with small amounts first
4. Keep logs for debugging (`--no-log` disables logging)

2. **Configure Test Environment**
   - Default configuration is in `config/config.ts`:
     ```typescript
     export const CONFIG = {
       TOKEN_ADDRESS: "YLf4BdNj1iiKiroGLGELNZrZQP9JtGGDkDfDcYLNiR1",
       WALLET_FILE: "./test-wallet.json",
       // ... other settings
     };
     ```
   - You can override settings using environment variables

3. **Create & Setup Test Tokens**
   ```bash
   # Create and mint test tokens
   npm run mint:test-tokens
   
   # Verify token creation
   npm run example:balance
   # Should show: Wallet balance: <SOL amount>, MTP: 1000000
   ```

   # Check token info
   npm run example:info
   
   # Transfer tokens
   npm run example:transfer
